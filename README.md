# Qiskit-Fall-Fest-2023
The Qiskit Fall Fest is a collection of worldwide quantum computing events on college campuses. Every Fall Fest event is organized and run by the students on each campus, with support from IBM Quantum.

I participated in one of the fall fests organized by OneQuantum Ghana. I have completed the given labs and the final challenge.
